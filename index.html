    <h1>About me (Benjamin Beeksma)</h1>
    
    <p>We have a saboteur aboard. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. They were just sucked into space. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Besides, you look good in a dress. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself.</p>
